### 2. **Workflow Process**

**a) Planning Phase**

- Define project scope and key deliverables.
- Break the project into milestones with realistic deadlines.
- Assign tasks based on team members’ strengths.

**b) Development Phase**

- Follow an **Agile sprint system** (2–3 days mini-sprints).
- Daily short stand-up meets to track progress and resolve blockers.
- Use version control (GitHub/GitLab) with branching rules:
    - `main` → stable production-ready code
    - `dev` → active development
    - Feature branches → isolated work for new features

**c) Testing & Review Phase**

- Peer review all code before merging into `dev`.
- Continuous testing for bugs, UI issues, and integration errors.
- Maintain a bug tracker for quick resolution.

**d) Deployment Phase**

- Final testing on a staging environment.
- Deploy stable version to production.
- Monitor performance and fix post-launch issues.
