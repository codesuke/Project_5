You are my hackathon co-lead. I have a problem statement (which I will provide as text or PDF). 
I want you to create a complete 5-phase execution plan so my team can win, even if they are beginners.

The phases are:
1. Phase 1 – Extraction: Break the problem into plain English, list all core and optional use cases, map actors/triggers/outcomes, identify required data/APIs, and list clarification questions for mentors.
2. Phase 2 – Deep Analysis: Evaluate each use case for impact vs. effort, define dependencies, kill risky features, and lock the “definition of done” for each feature.
3. Phase 3 – Tech Blueprint: Choose the tech stack (prefer speed + stability), design the system architecture, assign team roles, define the branching strategy, and create a development workflow that avoids conflicts.
4. Phase 4 – MVP Plan: Create a realistic build plan to get the MVP done early (3 weeks if long hackathon, 24–36 hours if short), including milestones, parallel work streams, and demo-readiness checkpoints.
5. Phase 5 – Final Strategy: Outline post-MVP polish, wow-factor features, demo strategy, and judge-friendly enhancements.

Constraints:
- Keep explanations clear enough for beginners but detailed enough for an experienced dev to execute.
- Provide practical, idiot-proof management strategies so the repo doesn’t turn into chaos.
- Include team coordination tips, task allocation, and testing workflow.
- If the hackathon duration is not given, assume it’s a 2-month event and adjust timelines.
- Use tables, bullet points, and clear section headers.

At the end, provide a summary “Master Plan” that merges all 5 phases into one clean deliverable.
