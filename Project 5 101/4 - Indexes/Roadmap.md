## Phase 1 – Extraction 

**Goal:** Translate the problem into plain, actionable English, identify everything we need, and clear confusion early.

| Step                                     | Action                                                      | Example (based on your PS-5)                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Plain English Summary**             | Rewrite the problem in one paragraph anyone can understand. | “We need to build a [X] that allows [Y] to do [Z] efficiently, while ensuring [A, B, C] constraints are met.” |
| **2. Core Use Cases**                    | Identify the main features we **must** build.               | - UC1: User can register/login.- UC2: [Main feature 1].- UC3: [Main feature 2].                               |
| **3. Optional Use Cases (Nice-to-have)** | Features that are cool but not critical for MVP.            | - Leaderboard, analytics, gamification, etc.                                                                  |
| **4. Actors / Triggers / Outcomes**      | Map who does what, when, and what happens after.            | Actor: User → Trigger: Clicks "Generate" → Outcome: System creates result.                                    |
| **5. Required Data/APIs**                | List APIs, datasets, 3rd party tools.                       | - External API: [Name + purpose].- Dataset: [Name + format].                                                  |
| **6. Questions for Mentors**             | Ask early to avoid scope creep.                             | - “Are we allowed to use pre-trained ML models?”- “What’s the expected scale of data?”                        |

## Phase 2 – Deep Analysis 

**Goal:** Pick battles we can win — maximize impact, minimize complexity.

|Step|Action|Method|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Impact vs. Effort Analysis**|Rate each feature on a 1–5 scale for impact & effort.|Prioritize high-impact, low-effort first.|
|**2. Define Dependencies**|Map what needs to be built first.|E.g., Can’t build dashboard without backend APIs.|
|**3. Kill Risky Features**|Drop anything that is high-effort & low-impact.|Example: Realtime chat if it’s not core.|
|**4. Lock “Definition of Done”**|For each feature, define exactly when it’s complete.|UC2 Done = Backend API working + front-end form functional + tested with 3 sample cases.|

---

## Phase 3 – Tech Blueprint (Might Change)

**Goal:** Set up the tech stack and dev process so beginners don’t break the repo.

|Step|Action|Recommendation|
|---|---|---|
|**1. Tech Stack Choice**|Favor stability, speed, and beginner-friendly tech.|Frontend: React + TailwindBackend: Node.js + ExpressDB: PostgreSQL / FirebaseAPIs: REST|
|**2. Architecture Design**|Keep it modular.|API layer ↔ Service layer ↔ DB layer; Frontend separated from backend.|
|**3. Team Roles**|Assign by strength/learning goals.|- Backend Lead- Frontend Lead- UI/UX- DevOps- Documentation|
|**4. Branching Strategy**|Use GitHub Flow.|- `main` (stable)- `dev` (integration)- `feature/*` (individual tasks)|
|**5. Dev Workflow**|Avoid merge hell.|PR reviews required, small commits, no direct pushes to `main`.|

## Phase 4 – MVP Plan 

**Goal:** Deliver something functional ASAP, then enhance.

**Timeline (2-Month Hackathon)**

|Week|Milestone|Parallel Work|
|---|---|---|
|1–2|Backend API skeleton + DB setup|Frontend scaffolding|
|3–4|Core use cases done|UI styling, testing starts|
|5|MVP freeze|Start optional features|
|6|Polish + bug fixes|Demo prep|
|7–8|Final integration + rehearsals|Add wow features|

**Demo-readiness checkpoints:**

- Core flow works on dummy data by Week 3.
- MVP usable by Week 5.
- All integration tested by Week 7.

## Phase 5 – Final Strategy 

**Goal:** Impress judges with polish, stability, and storytelling.

|Step|Action|
|---|---|
|**1. Post-MVP Polish**|Add micro-interactions, error handling, and clean UI.|
|**2. Wow-Factor Features**|AI-assisted insights, predictive analytics, or unique UI elements.|
|**3. Demo Strategy**|Show problem → MVP flow → impact. Keep under 5 min.|
|**4. Judge-Friendly Enhancements**|Metrics, screenshots, and clear value proposition in README.|

## **📜 Master Plan – End-to-End**

- **Phase 1:** Translate & dissect problem → list features → ask questions.
- **Phase 2:** Rank features by impact/effort → define done → cut dead weight.
- **Phase 3:** Lock stack → modular architecture → Git workflow.
- **Phase 4:** Build MVP first → parallel streams → freeze early → test.
- **Phase 5:** Polish → add wow factor → demo like a pro.
