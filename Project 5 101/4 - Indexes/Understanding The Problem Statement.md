# Understanding the Problem Statement

The challenge is essentially asking us to **design and build a solution** that addresses a specific real-world need, with the following focus points:

1. **What the system should do**    
    - It needs to allow **specific actors** (users, admins, maybe third-party systems) to perform certain tasks that solve the target problem.
    - These tasks are defined as _core use cases_ in the document.        
2. **Why it matters**
    - The hackathon is looking for **impact + usability** — meaning we can’t just make something flashy; it has to actually work and help the intended audience.
    - The more measurable and clear the benefits, the better our chance with judges.
3. **Expected output**
    - A working application or platform (likely web or mobile) that demonstrates all the _core_ features, while optionally including _bonus_ features for extra points.
    - Should have a clean UI, responsive flow, and predictable performance.
4. **Constraints to remember**
    - The time limit of the hackathon means we **must prioritize core features** over extras.
    - The tech stack choice needs to allow fast prototyping and stable deployment.
    - The solution should work reliably with the given data/APIs, or in an offline/demo mode if API calls fail.

## What We’re Building 

> “We’re making a system that lets [target users] easily [do main action(s)] by giving them tools to [manage/view/generate/process something], while ensuring that the process is smooth, fast, and accessible. Extra features like [optional perks] will make it stand out to judges.”

## **Immediate Takeaways for Our Team**

- The _core use cases_ are our MVP — **do them first**.
- The _optional use cases_ are our wow factor — **do them only after the MVP is done and stable**.    
- Every feature should have a **clear trigger, action, and outcome** so we don’t waste time debating implementation in the middle of coding.
- We will need **data sources/APIs** early — no waiting till the last week to integrate.
- This is not just a “build it” project; **storytelling in the demo** will matter.
