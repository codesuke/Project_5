## AI-Enabled Semantic Search for National Classification of Occupation (NCO)

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), Government of India, seeks an AI-enabled semantic search solution for the National Classification of Occupation (NCO) to streamline occupation classification processes.

### Problem Description

The NCO is a standardized system for classifying occupations in India, aligned with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO). The latest version, NCO-2015, includes detailed descriptions of 3,600 civilian occupations across 52 sectors, organized in an 8-digit hierarchical code structure.

Currently, users such as survey enumerators and employment officers rely on keyword-based searches within static PDF documents to identify occupation codes. This approach has significant limitations:

- **Time-consuming and error-prone**: Manual searches often lead to mistakes.
- **Not scalable**: Requires exact keyword matches, limiting efficiency.
- **Lacks semantic understanding**: Unable to interpret query context or intent.
- **Requires deep taxonomy knowledge**: Users must understand the classification hierarchy, e.g., finding the code for "Sewing Machine Operator" demands familiarity with divisions and sub-groups.

These challenges result in incorrect classifications, reducing data quality and hindering policy planning and productivity.

### Expected Solution

MoSPI seeks a prototype application with the following capabilities:

- **Data Ingestion**: Ingest and index NCO-2015 data for efficient processing.
- **Free-Text Input**: Allow users to input job titles or descriptions via text.
- **Semantic Search**: Return the top N matching occupation codes with relevance ranking and confidence scores.
- **Error Handling**: Provide fallback suggestions for ambiguous or incorrect queries.
- **Multilingual and Voice Support**: Optionally support voice input and multilingual queries (e.g., Hindi and regional languages).
- **Admin Panel**: Include tools for updating the occupation database and maintaining audit trails for search history.

### Key Features Required

The application must incorporate the following features:

#### 1. Data Ingestion & Processing
- Convert NCO datasets into structured formats (e.g., JSON or CSV).
- Normalize text for consistency across the dataset.
- Preserve and represent the hierarchical classification structure.

#### 2. Semantic Search Implementation
- Utilize NLP models (e.g., BERT or Sentence Transformers) to generate embeddings for semantic understanding.
- Store indexed embeddings in a fast-retrieval system (e.g., FAISS) for efficient querying.
- Return results with ranked relevance and confidence scores.

#### 3. Synonym & Context Handling
- Map synonyms and variations (e.g., "tailor" vs. "sewing machine operator").
- Maintain a bank of synonyms and related terms to enhance search accuracy.

#### 4. Query Interface
- Support text and voice input for user queries.
- Display top matches, allowing users to select the correct occupation code.
- Provide clear fallback and error messages for unmatched queries.
- Enable multilingual input, including Hindi and regional languages.
- Include dashboards for usage statistics, performance metrics, and audit trails.

### Impact Potential

The proposed solution offers significant benefits:

- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Streamlines tasks for enumerators, improving classification accuracy.
- **Enhanced Data Consistency**: Ensures uniform data across regions and surveys.
- **Faster Survey Preparation**: Decreases training time and accelerates processes.
- **Scalable Intelligence**: Enables robust, intelligent systems for national classification tasks.
- **Improved Policy Support**: Strengthens MoSPIâ€™s ability to deliver timely, high-quality, and policy-relevant statistics.
